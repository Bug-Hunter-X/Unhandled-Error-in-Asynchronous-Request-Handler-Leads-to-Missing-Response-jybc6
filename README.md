# Node.js Unhandled Asynchronous Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js where unhandled errors within asynchronous request handlers prevent the server from sending a response to the client.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:** The server simulates an asynchronous operation (e.g., database query) that might fail. If the operation fails, an error is logged to the console, but no response is sent to the client. This leads to hanging requests.

**Solution:**  Proper error handling is crucial. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to catch potential errors and send an appropriate error response to the client, preventing hanging requests.
